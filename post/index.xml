      <description>This project aims to analyze Uber data using an ensemble of modern tools and technologies. The goal is to understand patterns, draw insights, and inform decisions based on the analyzed data. The technologies used include Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Storage for housing the data, Python for scripting and data manipulation, Compute Instance for scalable computing power, Mage Data Pipeline Tool for managing and processing the data flow, BigQuery for querying large datasets, and Looker Studio for data visualization and exploration.</description>
